🧠 GhostKellz AI Gameplan — Q4 2025
🎯 Objective

Build a self-optimizing AI ecosystem centered on Zeke (CLI, nvim, grim), with Omen as the router, Glyph as the MCP backbone, Rune as the scripting layer, and GhostLLM as the engine hub.
Each project plays a defined role — no overlap, no scope creep.

⚡ Priority Tiers
Tier 1 — Foundation & Intelligence Layer
🔴 1. OMEN (Routing Intelligence)

Status: Alpha — critical path for Zeke scalability.
Purpose: AI routing daemon that decides which model/provider to use (Claude, GPT-5, Ollama, etc.).
Next Steps:

Implement health and latency probes for all active providers

Create /route API (intent-based dispatch: chat, code, analysis)

Integrate zqlite telemetry (routing_prefs, routing_stats, routing_trace)

Expose /api/health + /api/metrics endpoints for Glyph/Rune/Grim

End Goal: Zeke never calls OpenAI directly — everything goes through OMEN.

🔴 2. GhostLLM (Execution Backend)

Status: Early Beta
Purpose: Central model gateway (like LiteLLM but Rust-based). Handles unified inference, caching, and rate limiting.
Next Steps:

Add gRPC interface for Omen and Zeke

Implement caching by prompt hash

Add batch inference for async multi-model runs

Integrate Ollama connectors (local inference)

End Goal: GhostLLM = model execution engine behind Omen.

Tier 2 — Contextual Tooling & Ecosystem
🟡 3. Glyph (MCP + Tool Host)

Status: Stable — production-ready
Purpose: Acts as the Model Context Protocol hub — bridges editors, tools, and AI agents.
Next Steps:

Register Zeke as a tool in MCP registry

Add Omen + GhostLLM as “compute” backends

Integrate file ops and diff management

Add plugin manifests for Grim/Rune

End Goal: Glyph = control plane for the GhostKellz AI ecosystem.

🟡 4. Rune (Automation / Scripting Layer)

Status: Active Development
Purpose: Ghostlang-powered automation and scripting interface; lets AI chain actions.
Next Steps:

Define .rune spec (YAML + Ghostlang hybrid)

Add API bindings for Omen/GhostLLM/Glyph

Implement async task orchestration with zsync

Add scripting REPL

End Goal: Rune = automation brain that tells Zeke/Omen what to do next.

Tier 3 — Experience & Interfaces
🟢 5. Grim / Zeke.Grim (IDE Integration)

Status: MVP ready
Purpose: Grim (editor) and Zeke.Grim (plugin) make AI editing native, lightweight, and offline-capable.
Next Steps:

Finalize Zeke RPC integration

Implement Claude/Google login

Add diff UI and inline completions via Glyph

Enable Rune script execution inside Grim

End Goal: Grim = local AI IDE with Ghost ecosystem integration.

🟢 6. Phantom Layer (UX + Branding)

Status: Conceptual
Purpose: Provides unified UX skin for all tools (CLI, GUI, Web, Grim).
Next Steps:

Shared TUI/GUI style system

Animated branding and cross-project theme sync

CLI/UI consistency with Zeke, Glyph, Rune

End Goal: Phantom = unified interface language across all Ghost tools.

🔮 Future / Expansion Tier
🔵 7. GhostFlow (Automation + Workflow Engine)

Purpose: Visual and API-driven flow orchestrator (Rust n8n alternative).
Depends on Omen + GhostLLM stability.

🔵 8. Jarvis (AI Orchestration Layer)

Purpose: Multi-agent runtime coordinating Zeke, Rune, and Omen tasks dynamically.
Will depend on Rune v1.0 and Omen routing intelligence.

🧭 Recommended Execution Order (Q4 2025 → Q1 2026)
Phase	Project	Focus	Outcome
Oct 6–15	Zeke + Omen Alpha Integration	Solidify routing + provider APIs	Smart routing + Ollama aware
Oct 15–25	GhostLLM Backend	RPC + caching layer	Local + cloud inference hybrid
Oct 25–Nov 10	Glyph Integration	Register tools, unify file ops	End-to-end IDE → router loop
Nov 10–Dec 1	Rune Automation	Add scripting + workflows	AI agent orchestration
Dec → Jan	Grim Integration + Phantom UX	Unified experience	Developer-ready AI suite

🧠 Guiding Principle

Zeke thinks. Omen routes. GhostLLM speaks. Glyph connects. Rune acts. Grim creates.
